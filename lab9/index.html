        <p>My review for this movie The Woman King would be a 10/10. The reason why I said this was because the way it was written, you could tell 
            the writer studied Nollywood movies, which are movies produced by African countries just like how Hollywood is American. Also, the plot and 
            character development are beautiful. The character development of Nawi, a young girl who is adopted and given away, 
            she is later in a position where she meets her mother and they go to war together, that is a great storyline and 
            it was the main part of the whole movie and kept me wanting to know more.</p>
